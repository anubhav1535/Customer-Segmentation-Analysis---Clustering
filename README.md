# Customer Segmentation Analysis
1. Data Segmentation: Utilizing the K-means clustering algorithm, I divided the dataset into groups based on similarities in loyalty and satisfaction ratings. Each group, or cluster, encapsulated customers with similar patterns in their ratings.
   
2. Cluster Formation: The K-means algorithm iteratively assigned data points to clusters by minimizing the within-cluster sum of squared distances from the cluster centroids. This process resulted in clusters that were internally cohesive in terms of loyalty and satisfaction ratings.
 
3. Interpretation: Each cluster represented a distinct segment of customers characterized by their loyalty and satisfaction levels. By examining the characteristics of each cluster, such as average ratings or distribution patterns, insights could be gleaned into the different types of customers present in the dataset.
   
4. Analysis: The resulting clusters provided a framework for understanding customer behavior and preferences. Insights derived from the clusters could inform targeted marketing strategies, personalized offerings, and customer retention efforts tailored to the unique needs of each segment.
